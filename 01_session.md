# Introduction

## Prtocol
* protocols define format and order of messages sent and received among network entities and actions taken  on message trasmission/ receipt
* Acces networok 
  * digital subscriber line (DSL) - use existing telephone line 
  * cable network - rg59
* FIOS is dedicated symmetric connection
* What is better? Symmetric or Asymmetric 
  * If you are dong a lot of uploading then fios can be better 
  * if you are doing a lot of downloading codex means you have a higher download speed
* Ethernet


## Host: send packets of data
* packet transmission delay
* physical media
  - bit -propogates between transmitter/ receiver pairs
  - physical link - what lies btw transmitter and eceiver
  - guided media
  - unguided media
  - twisted pair

* twist in ethernet allows to cancel out electro magnetic interference 
* coaxial cable
  - two concentric copper conductors
  - bidirectional
  - broadband

* fiber optic cable
  - glass fiber carrying light pulses, each pulse a bit
  - high speed operation
  - low error rate

* physical media radio
  - signal carried in electromagnetic spectrum
  - no physica wire
  - bidirectional

* Radio link types
  - terrestial microwave - 45mbps
  - LAN - 54 mbps
  - wide-area - 4g cellular ~10mbps
  - satellite - kbps to 45 mbps
  - 270 msec end2end delay
  - geosynchronous vs low altitude
