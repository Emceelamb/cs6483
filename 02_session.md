## Session 02

* packet-switching - hosts breaks application-layer messages into packets
  * forward packets from one router to the next
  * each packet transmiteted at full link capacity
* store and forward
  * packets qeueue 

* routing - determines source-destination route taken by packets
  * routing algorithm sits in memory of rotuer
* forwarding - move packets from router's input to approrpriate router output

## circuit switching v. packet switching
* end-end resources allocated to reserved for "call" between source and destination
* FDM vs TDM
  * FDM is taking frequency and subdividing
  * TDM  is transmitting full frequency chunked by time
* 

## Networks of Networks
* ixp connects different isps
* peering link is direct connection
* regional networks
* global core 
* content provider network

## Delay and packet loss
Four sources of packet delay:
1. transmission
2. propagation
3. nodal processing
4. qeueuing delay

* queuing delay increases exponentially
* propagation 

* bottleneck link
  * only as fast as slowest link

* network reference model

* Internet protocol stack
  - application
  - transport
  - network
  - link
  - physical


* Moore's law - Moore's Law refers to Moore's perception that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles every two years, though the cost of computers is halved. Moore's Law states that we can expect the speed and capability of our computers to increase every couple of years, and we will pay less for them.

* router vs switch
  * end devices must have a switch to talk to a router
